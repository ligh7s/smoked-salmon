There are many, many changes in the prompts and visual display. Please be careful

as well.

## September 5th, 2018

Added a `SIMULTANEOUS_CONVERSIONS` option for the converter. This affects how many
transcodes and downconverts can run simultaneously.

## September 3rd, 2018

Lots of configuration changes. Image hosts gained a few new options; and the options
were shuffled slightly. `IMAGE_UPLOADER` is now the de-facto image uploader for general
image uploaders. `COVER_UPLOADER` is the uploader for the cover art. `SPECS_UPLOADER`
remains the uploader for spectrals. `imgur` and `vgy.me` were added as image uploader
options. `imgur` requires a client ID from the website. Each client ID is limited to
1,250 uploads per day. If you and a friend do not come close to this limit, you can
share the ID.

The webserver also has several new configuration options. `WEB_SPECTRALS_HOST` enables
viewing spectrals via a webserver instead of with feh. The other webserver options
are all overrides for default values if your setup is nonstandard. `WEB_HOST` is what
the script will print to stdout as the base URL for the salmon tool--if you are
reverse proxying the webserver, you will want to substitute this with your (sub)domain
and, if applicable, location block. `WEB_PORT` allows you to run the webserver on a port
other than the provided 55110. `WEB_STATIC_ROOT_URL` allows you to change the directory
for `/static` resources to match a location block change. For example, if you are hosting
this on `domain.tld/salmon`, set this option to `/salmon/static`.

## September 2nd, 2018

Puff added a webserver to the script. I got salmon running again by running
`pipenv install` in the salmon directory and making sure the db was up to date
with `salmon migrate`. If you're not running this in an environment, you might
want to `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` Booty said he'd update the wiki with
setting it up for nginx so let's hold him accountable.
